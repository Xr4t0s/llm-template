{"output":"To fully launch the Johnny Hallyday Meme Coin in the web3 environment, you need:\n\n1. Project Lore - A strong brand story defining identity, mascot, vision, and messaging.\n2. Documentation - Core docs including introduction, vision, roadmap, tokenomics (if any), and FAQ to educate and onboard users.\n3. Social Media Content - Ready-to-use Twitter and Telegram posts for announcements, engagement, education, and memes.\n\nI can help generate all these outputs now. Which would you like to receive first? The lore narrative, full project documentation, or social media posts? Or shall I proceed with generating all sequentially?"}
