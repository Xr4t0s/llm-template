{"output":"I have prepared the following for launching the Johnny Hallyday Meme Coin in the Web3 environment:\n\n1. Unified Project Lore: A consistent brand story including the core identity, origin, vision, values, unique selling points, mascot, tone of voice, and messaging pillars, all aligned to a meme and community-focused theme with a bold visual vibe.\n\n2. Full Documentation Set: Including introduction, vision, roadmap, tokenomics (if applicable), and FAQ, tailored with a meme tone and short, punchy style suitable for a meme coin project with a mascot.\n\n3. Social Media Content: 15 ready-to-publish posts optimized for Twitter and Telegram. These include announcements, engagement questions, educational posts, and memes designed to build community and spark conversation.\n\nWould you like me to deliver the full project lore text first, then the documentation files, and finally the social media posts? Or would you prefer me to send any part to you now?"}
