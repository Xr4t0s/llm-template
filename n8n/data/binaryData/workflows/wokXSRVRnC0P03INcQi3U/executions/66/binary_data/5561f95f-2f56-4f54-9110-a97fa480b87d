# Utility and Economic Model

## Overview
LLM Studio operates without its own native token. Instead, it focuses on utility through subscription-based access to automation and management services that enhance web3 project efficiency and security.

## Distribution
Since no token will be distributed, the economic engagement relies on service plans tailored to project scale and feature requirements.

## Utility and Incentives
- **Subscription tiers:** Access to different levels of features dependent on project needs.
- **Early adopter incentives:** Discounted plans and priority support for initial users.
- **Partner integrations:** Bundled options for ecosystem collaborators.

## Participation Logic
Users subscribe according to their operational scale and benefit directly from increased automation and productivity, with no reliance on token speculation.

## Sustainability
Revenue from subscriptions sustains platform development, security upgrades, and customer support, ensuring continuous value delivery without reliance on token market fluctuations.
