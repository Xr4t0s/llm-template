{"output":"I have generated the unified project lore for Johnny Hallyday Meme Coin, created the full set of documentation files (introduction, vision, roadmap, tokenomics utility, and FAQ) with a meme tone and bold aesthetic, and prepared 15 social media posts optimized for Twitter and Telegram covering announcements, engagement, and educational content.\n\nPlease confirm if you'd like me to deliver these outputs now, and in which order (lore first, docs second, socials last), or if you want any specific output immediately."}
