# MCP Tokenomics

> Note: MCP currently focuses on utility and platform growth. Tokenomics may be developed in future phases to incentivize participation and community engagement.

## Project Utility and Economic Model
MCP’s primary utility lies in its capacity to empower Web3 projects by saving time and resources through automated asset creation. The platform is designed for scalability and integration, with potential to introduce native tokens that fuel platform governance and incentivization programs.

## Distribution (If Applicable)
When applicable, token distribution will prioritize community participation, contributor rewards, strategic partnerships, and platform development funds to ensure sustainable growth and decentralization.

## Utility/Incentives
Tokens may be used to:
- Access premium features and advanced customization tools
- Participate in platform governance and decision-making
- Earn rewards for contributing to community-building efforts
- Unlock exclusive asset templates and partnership benefits

## Supply or Participation Logic
The total token supply will be fixed to prevent inflation and ensure lasting value. Participation mechanisms will encourage active usage and contributions, aligning incentives across developers, marketers, and community members.

## Future Considerations
Tokenomics and economic models will evolve through decentralized governance driven by the MCP community, ensuring transparency and alignment with collective goals.
