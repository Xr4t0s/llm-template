# Tokenomics of OrbitDAO

## Overview

OrbitDAO’s tokenomics are carefully designed to incentivize community participation, secure governance, and sustainable growth of the platform. The native token plays a pivotal role in governance participation, relayer incentivization, and empowering DAO autonomy.

## Token Distribution

- **Community and Ecosystem Growth:** 45% allocated towards community rewards, grants, and liquidity mining to foster active participation.
- **Team and Founders:** 20% vested over a multi-year schedule to ensure alignment with long-term project success.
- **Investors:** 15% allocated to strategic early supporters with vesting clauses.
- **Reserve Fund:** 15% kept for future strategic initiatives, partnerships, and ecosystem scaling.
- **Advisors:** 5% with vesting terms to align advisory contributions.

## Token Utility and Incentives

- **Governance:** Token holders propose and vote on protocol upgrades, parameter changes, and funding allocations.
- **Relayer Rewards:** Nodes facilitating cross-chain transaction proofs and automation earn token rewards.
- **Staking:** Token staking strengthens governance security and unlocks participation rights.

## Supply

The total supply is capped to prevent inflationary dilution, encouraging long-term holding and active network participation. Dynamic fee structures within the protocol adjust incentives based on network conditions.

OrbitDAO’s token model ensures a balanced, community-first approach that rewards contribution and fosters trustless governance.
