# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. What is OrbitDAO?
OrbitDAO is a community-owned DeFi protocol that enables DAOs to manage treasuries and governance across multiple blockchains securely and transparently, without custodians.

### 2. How does OrbitDAO ensure security?
The protocol utilizes cryptographic proofs and permissionless smart contracts to validate all transactions and governance actions on-chain.

### 3. What blockchains does OrbitDAO support?
OrbitDAO currently supports Ethereum and select Layer-2 networks, with plans to expand to additional blockchains.

### 4. Is OrbitDAO custodial?
No, OrbitDAO is fully non-custodial, allowing DAOs to retain absolute control over their assets.

### 5. How are governance votes conducted?
Governance is executed on-chain via auditable voting mechanisms that are permissionless and immutable.

### 6. Can DAOs automate fund allocation?
Yes, OrbitDAO supports smart contract-driven automation for treasury budgeting and fund distribution aligned with governance decisions.

### 7. What is the role of the mascot Eclipse?
Eclipse symbolizes OrbitDAO’s vigilant and enigmatic guardian persona, representing security and sovereignty.

### 8. How do I get started with OrbitDAO?
Connect your DAO’s wallets to the protocol interface, set up governance workflows, and engage your community in secure voting.

### 9. What makes OrbitDAO different from other DAO tools?
Unlike most tools limited to single chains or custodial models, OrbitDAO offers unified multi-chain management, a dark immersive UI, and full sovereign control.

### 10. Is the code open source?
Yes, transparency is core to OrbitDAO, and all smart contracts are publicly auditable.

### 11. How does OrbitDAO handle multi-chain treasury?
OrbitDAO aggregates DAO funds across compatible chains into a single interface, enabling unified governance and fund control.

### 12. What are relayers and how are they incentivized?
Relayers submit proofs and transactions on behalf of DAOs across chains and are rewarded via protocol tokens.

### 13. Can I propose changes to OrbitDAO?
Token holders can initiate governance proposals for changes, upgrades, or funding through the platform.

### 14. How does OrbitDAO protect user privacy?
While governance and treasury data are transparent and auditable, cryptographic techniques safeguard user keys and voting identities.

### 15. What is the future roadmap?
Expanding blockchain support, introducing AI governance tools, enhancing automation, and transitioning to community DAO ownership.
