# Tokenomics (Or Lack Thereof) 💤

Undefined operates without a traditional token model. Instead, we focus on building utility-first experiences that reward participation and creativity through:

## Distribution
No token distribution at this stage — we’re all about community growth and service quality.

## Utility & Incentives
- Tiered access to advanced customization and early features.
- Community recognition for meme contests and participation.
- Voting rights for future platform features and mascot evolution.

## Supply & Participation
Rather than token supply, we value user engagement metrics and meme contributions to keep the ecosystem pumping.

## Why No Token?
Focusing on utility avoids the pitfalls of pump-and-dump models, aligning incentives with long-term project health and meme-culture vitality.
