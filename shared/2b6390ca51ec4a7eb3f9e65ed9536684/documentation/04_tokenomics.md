# Utility and Economic Model of LLM Studio

## Project Utility
LLM Studio is designed as a utility tool rather than a token-based project. It focuses on delivering tangible value through software and services that streamline Web3 development processes.

## Participation Logic
Users participate by creating projects on the platform, accessing features based on subscription models or usage tiers, without the need for proprietary tokens.

## Incentives
- **Efficiency Gains:** Automating manual tasks reduces operational costs.
- **Security Assurance:** Built-in security minimizes risk, saving resources.
- **Scalability:** Supports growth without additional overhead.

## Distribution
As a service platform, LLM Studio does not involve token distribution. Instead, it offers flexible subscription plans and enterprise licensing to accommodate different user needs.

## Economic Model
Revenue is generated through usage fees, premium features, and partnerships:
- **Subscription Tiers:** Basic, professional, and enterprise levels with ascending feature access.
- **Consulting Services:** Custom integration and development support.
- **Marketplace Modules:** Additional paid tools and plug-ins developed by third parties.

This model ensures sustainable development and continuous enhancement of platform capabilities to support the Web3 ecosystem.
