# Utility Model and Economic Structure

LLM Studio adopts a purely utility-focused model without issuing its own token. This approach emphasizes sustainable platform value driven by product excellence rather than speculative trading.

## Economic Model
- **Subscription-Based Access:** Users subscribe to tailored plans based on their project scale and needs, receiving full feature access accordingly.
- **No Native Token:** Choosing to forgo issuing a token avoids regulatory uncertainty and speculative volatility.
- **Incentive Programs:** Rewards and loyalty offerings encourage community growth and engagement.

## Participation Logic
Users engage by leveraging LLM Studio’s tools for Web3 project management, contributing feedback to improve the platform continuously, with monetary value aligned to actual service consumption rather than token appreciation.

This model ensures that success is sustainable and directly tied to user benefit and product utility.
